# Step-Up
StepUp, a step counter application. StepUp exploits off-the-shelf, sensor-enabled mobile phones to automatically infer the number of steps the user walked. We discuss results of the deployment of StepUp on off-the-shelf mobile phones. We implemented StepUp on Nokia N95 8GB phones. The application is written in Symbian C++ and Java.
